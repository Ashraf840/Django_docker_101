Took the inspiration from the following YouTube video link.

Use image to build the docker container instead of the current directory's Dockerfile
Link:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/41481489

To enter the shell into a container service
	->  docker-compose ps -a
	->  docker-compose exec -it serviceName sh

Build & run docker-compose package
	-> [Specific docker-compose.yml file] docker-compose -f custom-docker-compose.yml up --build
	-> [Build & run in a detached mode; user "-d" flag] docker-compose up -d

Define a specific host port in the docker-compose yml file.
	-> ports:
		- 80:8080
		The host port of 80 will connect to the clustered container port of 8080.

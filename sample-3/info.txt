Buidl a docker image based on ubuntu:22.04
This image is instructed to install redis-server & lastly run redis-server. The last command is the entrypoint of the docker-container build with this image later.
----------------------------------------------------- [Note whcih packages are required to isntall & run nginx properly]
After noting the required steps to work with nginx inside a container, write a Dockerfile basing on the custom docker image (ubuntu-22.04:redis-server-1.1).
Lastly check this new docker image by running in the laptop.
Resources: The related shell-script file contains how to run nginx as "daemon off" mode. This script file will be executed as the entrypoint of the docker containers build from this docker image.
